## The Microsoft Bot Framework 

Bot Solutions/Tools.

The Microsoft Bot Framework provide you tools to build, test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots all in one place. Using modular and extensible framework provided by the SDK and Tools, you can leverage .NET or JavaScript to create your Bots.

When you choose this framework, you start with a blank sheet, where you will need a development team to create all the functionality and features for your scenarios.

The Bot Framework can easily integrate with our language understanding service LUIS, to support conversational A.I. You can also easily hook into other A.I. solutions from the Cognitive Services, or anything that is accessible via code.

Because this is built on top of the Bot Connector Service, you can easily make use of different channels such as Web, Teams, SMS, …

The cost for this service is based on your Azure services, such as the Web App and Bot connector Service, to host your bot.
